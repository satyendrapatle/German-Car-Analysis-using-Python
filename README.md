# German-Car-Analysis-using-Python
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of data on German cars sourced.


Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of data on German cars sourced from the AutoScout24 website, one of the largest car marketplaces in Europe. The dataset spans from 2011 to 2021 and consists of 46,405 rows and 9 columns, providing a rich source of information for examining various trends and relationships in the automotive market.

Key Findings

Extensive analysis uncovered several significant relationships and trends between various variables in the dataset.

2017 Anomaly:
A notable anomaly was discovered in the 2017 production data. Gasoline cars were the least represented in this year, while diesel cars were the most widely represented.
Additionally, from 2017 onwards, there was a clear downward trend in the number of cars with manual transmissions and an increase in those with automatic transmissions.

Technical Approach

Data Visualization Tool: The analysis and visualization of the data were carried out using Power BI, leveraging its powerful capabilities to create insightful and interactive visualizations.

Data Processing: The dataset was processed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and relevance in the visualizations and findings.

Visualization Goals: The visualizations aimed to clearly depict the identified trends, anomalies, and relationships within the data, providing a comprehensive understanding of the German car market over the given period.
